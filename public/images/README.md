# Background images

Copy your two reference images here with these exact names:

1. **bg-white-pattern.png** — White with undulating line pattern (used as Protocol stacking background)
2. **bg-black-iridescent.png** — Deep black with luminous iridescent objects (used for Hero and Philosophy)

If the files are missing, the app still works: Hero/Philosophy use the gradient + any URL from Settings; Protocol uses a light solid background.
